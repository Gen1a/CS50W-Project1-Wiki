# Javascript

From [JavaScript's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): *Javascript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.*
